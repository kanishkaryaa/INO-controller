# INO-controller
A simple Arduino project that uses cv2 and mediapipe to control the motion of a real appliance like a fan or a bulb. 




NOTE: Run the code on Python 3.10.6(most preferable) or lower versions as during the time of building the project the latest version of python doesn't support some opencv and mediapipe libraries.




Install PyFirmata using the command "pip install pyfirmata".




Install Arduino IDE (link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).




Before uploading the code to Arduino using Arduino IDE, you need to install CH340 driver.
